1) What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which       developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.

2)  List of all Basic Git Command.
    a) git init <directory>
       By executing this command  "git init‚Äù , a .git directory will be created inside the project directory.
       This.git directory contains all the metadata of the repository and maintains track of all the changes made to the files in our repository,by keeping commit history.
    b) git clone <repository>
       clone / download a repository onto local machine.
    c) git clone [URL] [folder]
       clone a repository from a remote location into a specified folder [folder] on our local machine.
    d) git branch
       list all branches in the repository
    e) git branch -a
       list all the remote branches
    f) git branch [branch]
       create a new branch under the specified name.
    g) git checkout [branch]
       switch to another branch [ an existing one]
    h) git checkout -b <branch>
       Create and check out a new branch named <branch>. Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch.
    i) git branch -d [branch]
       delete a local branch
    j) git branch -m [new_branch_name]
       rename the branch we are currently working in
    k) git merge [branch]
       merge the specified branch with the current branch
    l) git config user.name <name>
       Define author name to be used for all commits in current repository.
    m) git add [file/directory]
       Stage all changes in <directory> or a <file> for the next commit.
    n) git add .
       stage everything in the directory for an initial commit.
    o) git commit -m "[descriptive_message]"
       Commit the staged snapshot,use <message> as the commit message.
    p) git status
       show the state of the current directory (along with staged,unstaged, and untracked files)
    q) git log
       list the complete commit history of the current branch.
    r) git log --all
       list all commits from all branches.
    s) git diff
       It shows the difference between the working directory and the index(which changes have not been commited yet).
    t) git remote add [name][URL]
       create a new connection to a remote repository and give it a name to serve as a shortcut to the URL.
    u) git fetch [remote_repo][branch]
       fetch a branch from a remote repository
    v) git pull [remote_repo]
       fetch the specified repository and merge it with the local copy
    w) git push [remote_repo][branch]
       push a branch to a remote repository with all its commits and objects.

 3)  Steps for pushing(Check-In) the code in git repository?
     a) git init
     b) git add remote origin <url>
     c) git status
     d) git add .(everything in the directory for an initial commit.)
     e) git status ( again we check the status)
     f) git commit -m " test"
     g) git push origin master
      Error occurs (permission denied we get while pushing the code to branch).To access SSH key is needed(Through putty it can be generated).
      add SSH key ( again run)
     h) git push origin master(ask for laptop password) - enter - Complete code will be pushed to git repository.
     
 4) steps for pulling/Checkout  the code.
    a) Go to command prompt ,make own directory (mkdir selenium)-Go to selenium directory
    b) git clone https://github.com/Ms507376/SeleniumJava.git ( while pulling the code cloning is needed  to copy code in local machine)- Code is present in local dir
    c) open eclipse--> importcode
    d)If someone is again modifying the code in repository (How to take again in local)
      git pull origin master(Clone is done only once ,pull can be done multiple times)
      
 5) How will you differentiate between git pull and git fetch?
     Git pull :It pulls all new commits from a specific branch in the central repository and makes the target branch in our local repository up-to-date.
     Git fetch:All the new commits from a specific branch will be pulled in our central repository and these changes will be stored in a new branch in our local repository.                  This is called a fetched branch.
